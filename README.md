Prediction of heart disease using ML model with accurate risk prediction
Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Heart disease continues to be one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early detection and prevention critically important. Leveraging the power of machine learning, this project aims to build predictive models that assist in identifying patients at risk of heart disease with high accuracy.

This study involves comprehensive analysis and preprocessing of a heart disease dataset, followed by training and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms to perform binary classification—predicting whether or not a patient is likely to develop heart disease based on several medical parameters.

Machine Learning Techniques Implemented:
Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)

Support Vector Machine – Linear Kernel (Scikit-learn)

K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)

Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)

Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

XGBoost (Scikit-learn)

Artificial Neural Network with a Single Hidden Layer (Keras)
