## 🔍 Project Overview

Heart disease continues to be one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making **early detection and prevention critically important**.  
This project leverages the power of **machine learning** to build predictive models that identify patients at risk of heart disease based on key medical parameters.

The system performs **binary classification**, predicting whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease or not, using multiple supervised learning algorithms.
